# Face-detection-using-HaarCascade
The OpenCV library maintains a repository of pre-trained Haar cascades.
The github link to Haar Cascade model is https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades which has a series of models to train your model with.
I utilised HaarCascade frontal face xml file to built a face detection model.
